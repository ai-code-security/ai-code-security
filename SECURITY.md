## Security Best Practices

If you're using this framework, we recommend:

1. **Keep dependencies updated** — Run `npm audit` or equivalent regularly
2. **Use the Guardian Prompt** — It catches many issues during development
3. **Complete the Pre-Launch Checklist** — Before every production deployment
4. **Subscribe to Signals** — Stay informed about emerging threats
